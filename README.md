A webapp that helps you add your todoâ€™s and delete it when you are done with it.
Check out the live project here: https://mysterious-crag-51292.herokuapp.com<br>
You can create dynamic to-do pages by passing the name of the to-do page in url as path-name (https://mysterious-crag-51292.herokuapp.com/page_name)
If that to-do page already exists, it will be displayed , else a whole new to-do page will be created.
